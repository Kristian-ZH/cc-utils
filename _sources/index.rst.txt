This documentation describes how the components of the `Gardener <https://github.com/gardener>`_ project
are produced. See the linked documentation for more details on Gardener itself.


Overview
========

.. image:: res/overview.svg


Gardener is tightly integrated into GitHub. In particular, each Gardener
Component is represented by exactly one GitHub repository. Releases of Gardener
Components are represented by GitHub releases.

As is common practice in the Kubernetes eco-system, the main deliverables of
each Gardener Component are container images. Each release of a Gardener
Component thus also encompasses a `Component Descriptor`, which declares
references to any container images that have been created for a given component
release.
